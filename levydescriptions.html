 	The margin is a fixed maximum monetary margin. The formula used to determine the wholesale margin is based on a set of Guidelines, namely the Marketing-of-Petroleum- Activities Return. The level of the margin is calculated on an industry average basis and is aimed at granting these marketers a benchmark return of 15 percent on depreciated book values of assets, with allowance for additional depreciation, but before tax and payment of interest. Should the industry aggregated margin be between 10 and 20 percent, no adjustment is made to the margin, if it is below 10 percent or above 20 percent, the margin is adjusted to a level of 15 percent.
